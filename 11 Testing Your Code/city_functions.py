# â€œCreate a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote
# (remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test).
# Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function
# with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string.
# Run test_cities.py, and make sure test_city_country() passes.
