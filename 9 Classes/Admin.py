# An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called Admin
# that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 162)
# or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). Add an attribute, privileges, that stores
# a list of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user",
#  and so on. Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the
# administratorâ€™s set of privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
