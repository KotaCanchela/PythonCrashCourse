# An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called IceCreamStand that inherits from
#  the Restaurant class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 167).
# Either version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better.
# Add an attribute called flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays these flavors.
# Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.‚Äù
