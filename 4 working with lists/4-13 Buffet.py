# â€œ4-13. Buffet: A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods.
# Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
# Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
# Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
# The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods.
# dd a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.
