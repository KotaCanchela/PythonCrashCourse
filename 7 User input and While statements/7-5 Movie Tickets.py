#  A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
#  If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12,
#  the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15.
#  Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.

# The loop doesn't make too much sense if it quits after one answer.
# So I added a 'quit' variable and added a total tickets price at the end
